        "**Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs)** represent a revolutionary development in 3D scene understanding by combining volumetric rendering with deep learning. Introduced by *Mildenhall et al.* in 2020, NeRFs use fully connected neural networks to model the radiance and density of 3D points from sparse sets of 2D images. This enables highly realistic 3D scene reconstruction and view synthesis, marking a major leap forward in computer vision, graphics, and AI-driven spatial understanding.\n",

        "* **View-Dependent Effects**: Incorporating the viewing direction allows NeRF to model complex lighting phenomena like specular highlights and reflections.\n",
        "* **Photometric Supervision**: The model is trained end-to-end to minimize pixel-wise reconstruction error between rendered and ground truth images.\n",
        "* **Differentiability**: NeRF’s architecture enables gradient-based optimization, making it trainable from raw image data without explicit 3D supervision.\n",
